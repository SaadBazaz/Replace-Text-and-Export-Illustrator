# Text Replacer and Export Script
For Adobe Illustrator (tested on 2021).

## How to use
1. Open the certificate template in Illustrator
2. Rename the TextField which should contain the participant's name, to "Name"
3. Download the "Replacer.js" script
4. Open Illustrator, File -> Scripts -> Other Script...
5. A dialog box will open. Open the script which you downloaded in Step 4.
6. Indicate the AI file.
7. Another dialog will open. Indicate the CSV file which it should use (It will take the first column as names)
8. Finally, the last dialog will open. Indicate the folder where it should save it.
9. Done!

## Best for
- Certificates
- Wedding cards
- Invitations
- Whitelabeled graphics

## ToDo 
- Make this script generic, so it can replace text with {{curly braces}} from CSVs.
- Make a better [input form](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop/dialog-box-with-input-text/td-p/10161326?page=1)
## Notes
